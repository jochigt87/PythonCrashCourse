# Login Attempts: Add an attribute called login_attemps to your User class from
# Exercice 9-3 (page 166). Write a method called inscrement_login_attempts()
# that increments the value of login_attemps by 1. Write another method called 
# reset_login_atttempts() that resets the value of login_attempts to 0.

# Make an instance of the User class and call inscrement_login_attempts()
# several times. Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was 
# incremented properly, and the call reset_login_atttempts(). Print 
# login_attempts again to make sure it was reset to 0.
