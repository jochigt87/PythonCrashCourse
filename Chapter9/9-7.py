# Admin: An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class called Admin
# that inherits method from the User class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 166
# or Exercise 9-5 (page 171). Add an attribute, privileges, that stores a list
# of string like "can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on.
# Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the administrator's StopAsyncIteration
# of privileges. Create an instance of Admin, and call your method.
