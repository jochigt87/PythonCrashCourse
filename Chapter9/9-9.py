# Battery Upgrade: Use the final version of electric_car.py from this section. 
# Add a method to the Battery class called upgrade_battery(). This method 
# should check the battery size and set the capacity to 85 if it isnt already.
# Make an electric car witha default battry size, call get_range() once, and 
# then call get_range() a second time after upgrading the battery. You should 
# see an increase in the car's range.
