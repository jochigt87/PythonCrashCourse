# Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and
# last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically
# stored in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a
# summary of the user's information. Make another method called greet_user()
# prints a personalized greeting to other user.

# Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
# for each user.
