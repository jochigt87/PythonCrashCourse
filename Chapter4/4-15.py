# Code Review:
# *Choose three of the programs you've written in this chapter and modify each
# one to comply with PEP 8:

# Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to insert
# four spaces every time you press TAB, if you haven't already done so
# (see Appendix B for instructions on how to do this).

# Use less than 80 characteres on each line, and set your editor to show a
# vertical guideline at the 80th character position.

# Don't use blank lines excessively in your program files.
