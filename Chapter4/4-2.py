# Animals :
# Think of at least three different animals that have a common
# characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and
# then use a for loop print out the name of each animal.

# * Modify your program to print a statement about each animal,
# such as A dog would make a great pet.

# * Add a line at the end of your program starting what these animals
# have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these
# animals would make a great pet!
