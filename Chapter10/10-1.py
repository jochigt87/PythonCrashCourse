# Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines
# summarizing what you've learnedabout Python so far. Start each line with the
# phrase in Python you can... Save the file as leaning_python.txt in the same 
# directory as you wrote three times. Print the contents once by reading in 
# the entire file, once by looping over the file object, and once by storing 
# the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.
