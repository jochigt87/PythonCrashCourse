# Your Ideas:
# *At this point, you're more capable programmer than you were when you
# started this book. Now that you have a better sense of how real-world
# situations are modeled in programs, you might be thinking of some problems
# you could solve with your programs. Record any new ideas you have about
# problems you might want to solve as your programming skills continue to
# improve. Consider games you might want to write, data sets you might want to
# explore, and web applications you'd like to create.
